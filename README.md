An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing), and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site.

## Running Picasso

To run Picasso, run `picasso.Main`

## Project Organization

`src` - the source code for the project

`conf` - the configuration files for the project

`images` - contains some sample images generated from Picasso. Some of the expressions for these images can be found in the `expressions` directory.

## Code Base History

This code base originated as a project in a course at Duke University.  The professors realized that the code could be designed better and refactored.  This code base has some code leftover from the original version.

## Extensions

The iterate fractals extension is used by inputting Mandelbrot(x, y) into the GUI. To be able to view the Mandelbrot fractals in their entirety and to "zoom out" it is recommended to use mandelbrot(x + x, y + y).
